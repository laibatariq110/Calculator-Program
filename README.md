## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: Contains the structure of the calculator.
2. `style.css`: Provides the styling for the calculator.
3. `script.js`: Contains the logic for the calculator operations.

## Getting Started

To run the calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## HTML

The `index.html` file defines the layout of the calculator. It includes:

- A display area to show the input and result.
- Buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), decimal point (.), equal sign (=), and clear (C).

## CSS

The 'style.css' file contains the styling for the calculator to make it visually appealing.

## JavaScript

The 'script.js' file contains the functionality for the calculator:

- 'appendToDisplay(data)': Appends the clicked button value to the display.
- 'clearDisplay()': Clears the display.
- 'calculate()': Evaluates the expression in the display and shows the result.

## Usage

1. Open 'index.html' in a web browser.
2. Use the buttons to perform calculations:
    - Enter numbers and operators.
    - Click '=' to get the result.
    - Click 'C' to clear the display.
